## Overview
Snakes and Ladders Game is an ancient game created to depict the struggle faced by humans through good and evil forces as they go through life. The ladders represent moving up to a higher moral plane with the help of benevolent beings, while going down the snakes represent being dragged down to a more immoral level through evil powers. Snakes and Ladders game was designed for 2 or more players and is played on a board with 100 squares numbered 1 to 100. Play begins on square 1 and finishes on square 100. Players take turns to roll a dice and move along the number rolled. If a player rolls a 6, the player may, after moving, immediately take another turn; otherwise play passes to the next player in turn. If a player lands on a square that has the bottom of a ladder upon it, the position is automatically advanced to the top of the ladder. Similarly, if a player lands on a square, which has the head of a snake upon it, then the player must automatically follow down to the tail of the snake. The winner is the player who is first to land on the square numbered 100. You must roll the exact number needed to land on 100.
